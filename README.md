# FIEP_InsideInflation
A econometric inflation analysis &amp; forecasting dashboard in Python

This repository contains the complete code for a local version of our dashboard app. This means, the data is imported from prepared Excel files, as the 'original' data import is quite complex. Thus, I decided to provide you here with a 'reduced form' code of our app, that you can run easily on your own machine by just downloading:

- The Python files
  -> Overview.py
  -> everything in the \pages directory

- The locally-saved data
  -> usa.xlsx
  -> euroarea.xlsx
  -> cpi.xlsx
  
  
After that, you can run our dashboard by just opening a terminal (of course, in the right directory) and using streamlit:

streamlit run Overview.py

Have fun trying InsideInflation!
